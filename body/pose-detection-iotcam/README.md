# pose-detection-iotcam

A simple node that recognizes and visualizes pose using a external camera device which support Samsung Smartthings.

## Pre-requisites

First, pose-detection-iotcam node requires [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed. This node uses FFmpeg to receive rtsp streaming data and display it to the screen.

Second, you need to update `node_modules/node-rtsp-stream/mpeg1muxer.js` like below.

```JavaScript
...
 this.spawnOptions = [
    "-rtsp_transport", "tcp", "-i",
    this.url,
    '-f',
    'mpeg1video',
    '-b:v', '1000k',
    '-maxrate', '1000k',
    '-bufsize', '1000k',
     '-an', '-r', '24',
    // additional ffmpeg options go here
    ...this.additionalFlags,
    '-'
  ]
...
```

## Usage

This node provides body tracking in a browser environment to recognize body pose.

This node provides exactly the same function as the `pose-detection-webcam` node, but there is a difference in using an external camera device. We recommend using Samsung's 'SmartThings' IoT camera. When a person is recognized on a webcam, 33 landmark coordinates are predicted and visually shown as shown in the picture below.

Specify a pose to save and press the capture button to record the pose model at a specific time. When the pose is captured, the image and coordinate information are displayed. Check the registration status through the `register` and `cancel` buttons.

## Properties

### Server Url

URL address of your websocket server for monitoring and receiving streaming data from the camera. Do not include a prefix such as 'http://'. This is an attribute input item to facilitate both local and deployment environments. (default: 'localhost')

### Monitor Port

Port number to be used to monitor pose recognition results from other resources. To use properly, you need to match this value with `Monitor Port` attribute of [the monitor node](https://github.com/5FNSaaS/node-red-contrib-motion-pose/tree/master/monitor). (default: 1882)

### Rtsp Port

Port number to be used to receive streaming data from your Samsung Smartthings camera device. (default: 1886)

### Data Socket Url

Specify the URL including the endpoint to receive the user's pose recognition result data in real time using a WebSocket. (default: 'ws://localhost:1880/ws/data')

### Smartthings MNID

Your MNID to get access to your Samsung Smartthings camera device. You can check your MNID on [this page](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/partner/dashboard).

### Smartthings PAT

Your PAT to get access to your Samsung Smartthings camera device. You can generate a PAT on [this page](https://account.smartthings.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.smartthings.com%2Ftokens).

## Example

This is an example of a JSON string of data from a browser through a websocket. Note that if the data is newly registered data, the value of the `regist` is displayed as true.
